<h3>The VeTranscriber</h3>

A project for Shamhacks 2018 -- a veteran themed hackathon<br>
By Tanner Winkelman, Lucas Winkelman, and Christopher O'Toole<br>
The VeTranscriber is a website that allows people to upload videos.  It automatically transcribes the audio from videos to text, which may take a few minutes for a video over an hour long. Then the videos can be search by content.  Google Cloud is utilized for the transcription.  Files of a number of formats, including some audio formats, are supported.
