<h3>The VeTranscriber</h3>


A project for Shamhacks 2018 - a veteran themed hackathon<br>
By Tanner Winkelman, Lucas Winkelman, and Christopher O'Toole<br>
The VeTranscriber is a website that allows people to upload videos.  It automatically transcribes the audio from videos to text, which may take a few minutes for a video over an hour long. Then the videos can be searched by content.  Google Cloud is utilized for the transcription.  Multiple file formats are supported,  including some audio formats.  The VeTranscriber uses PHP and Python with a MySQL database.

I just discovered that the actual files were not uploaded to GitHub, and probably not Devpost either.  There's no way for me to see what I uploaded to Devpost, but GitHub had files with the names of the actual files but nonsense content.  It turns out that my Mac had made [Aliases][1].  Aliases are a Mac thing.  When I double click an alias, it opens the original.  But if I upload the alias to Google Drive, it uploads a file with the correct name but nonsense content.  My Mac generates an alias when I drag a file from one finder window to another and it appears to copy the file.<br>
I have replaced the aliases with actual files.
